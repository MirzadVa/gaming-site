# Simple Gaming Web site

A simple website where users can view, order, buy video games

## Available Stuff

Currently, users can only view and search video games that are on the website itself.

## Future Plans

For the next period, a panel will be available where users will be able to create a new account, and after that to log in to their account. Users will be able to create their own wishlist where they will be able to store games they would like to order in the future.

The game gets data from API and Firebase database is currently used to store some simple data. 
It will soon be added its own back-end with its own database.

## Technologies used:
  ### `HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js`
  ### `Firebase` as database simulation.
  ### `https://api.rawg.io/docs/` API
